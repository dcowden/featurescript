FeatureScript is a way to extend [Onshape](http://www.onshape.com) with really cool custom features. Sadly, Onshape does not provide a 'Featurescript Store' that lists all of the really good ones.  The official [Onshape list of FeatureScripts](https://www.onshape.com/featurescript) is not comprehensive or categorized.

*Full Disclosure* I created several features in the list below , but they make up a small fraction of the total, and they have not received any special categorization or treatment
