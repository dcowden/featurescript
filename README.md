![Awesome](https://github.com/dcowden/featurescript/raw/master/awesome.png)

FeatureScript is a way to extend [Onshape](http://www.onshape.com) with really cool custom features. Sadly, Onshape does not provide a 'Featurescript Store' that lists all of the really good ones.  The official [Onshape list of FeatureScripts](https://www.onshape.com/featurescript) is not comprehensive or categorized.

### Road Map
This list is and will always be community edited. Future plans include adding authors, pictures, and a rating/voting system.

#### Submitting Changes/Additions
Feedback is welcome!  Please [log an issue](https://github.com/dcowden/featurescript/issues/new) or submit a Pull Request if you have changes you recommend.
