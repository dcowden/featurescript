FeatureScript is a way to extend [Onshape](http://www.onshape.com) with really cool custom features. Sadly, Onshape does not provide a 'Featurescript Store' that lists all of the really good ones. Its official [list of FeatureScripts](https://www.onshape.com/featurescript) is not comprehensive or categorized. Onshape, however, does have another [FeatureScript](https://cad.onshape.com/FsDoc/) page with [tutorials](https://cad.onshape.com/FsDoc/tutorials/create-a-slot-feature.html) and [documentation](https://cad.onshape.com/FsDoc/library.html). You can also view the [Onshape Standard Library Source](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/12312312345abcabcabcdeff).

### Road Map
This list is and will always be community edited. Future plans include adding authors, pictures, and a rating/voting system.

#### Submitting Changes/Additions
Feedback is welcome!  Please [log an issue](https://github.com/dcowden/featurescript/issues/new) or submit a Pull Request if you have changes you recommend.
